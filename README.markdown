# Sadblock

The loneliest ad-blocker in the world.

## Why

This started as a joke after I sat on the sidelines during a heated discussion about the ethics of using ad-blocking software, and had no strong opinion on the matter.  An impasse was reached that perhaps, just perhaps, an extension that prevented a user from viewing content _as well as_ advertising might be more ethically palatable.

Things are a little bit temperamental right now, but they'll probably improve over time.

## Todo

Help with any of these things would be appreciated:

1. Get a better logo.
2. Have somebody that cares enough write a manifesto for the blocking page.
3. Rip out most of the guts of AdBlock except for the minimal functionality needed, in particular the really sketchy unique identification stuff.
4. Allow users to view a page by agreeing to permit it to advertise and track.
5. Localise content-blocking page/manifesto.

I'm also acutely aware that the CSS-selector based blocking is somewhat inefficient; this will be fixed when I figure a better way to do it.

## Installation

Sadblock *is not ready* to be uploaded to the Chrome Web Store, but it can be installed by hand if you're particularly brave:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Enable "Developer Mode" in the Google Chrome extensions configuration page.
3. Select "Load unpacked extension...".
4. Browse to the location where you cloned the repository.

I haven't had time to implement support for Safari yet, but it'll happen.

## Thanks

With thanks (and apologies) to the [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com/) team.
